### Gameplay modifications
* Changed: Reimplemented beam upgrades to stack on top of each other instead of only considering the highest obtained beam upgrade. Beam graphics are modified such that each beam combination can be easily differentiated at a glance.
  * Charge Beam: Allows the player to charge the beam, and buffs beam damage if only shooting one projectile.
  * Wide Beam: Shoots three beam projectiles, and adds a minor amount of damage.
  * Plasma Beam: Allows the beam to pierce enemies, reducing initial damage in favor of damage per tick.
  * Wave Beam: Allows the beam to pass through walls, and adds a significant amount of damage. Shots without wide beam also fire two projectiles instead of one.
  * Ice Beam: Freezes most enemies on contact, and adds a minor amount of damage.
* Changed: Reimplemented missile upgrades to stack on top of each other instead of only considering the highest obtained missile upgrade. Missile graphics are modified such that basic missiles have a purple tip, super missiles have a green tip, and super missiles take priority over the ice and diffusion missile graphics.
  * Main Missile Data: Allows the player to shoot missiles.
  * Super Missiles: Allows missiles to damage super missile gerons, and adds a major amount of damage and attack cooldown.
  * Ice Missiles: Freezes most enemies on contact, and adds a significant amount of damage and attack cooldown.
  * Diffusion Missiles: Allows the player to charge a radial area of effect freeze, but does not allow missiles to freeze enemies on contact. Adds a minor amount of damage and attack cooldown.
* Changed: Split the properties of varia suit and gravity suit. Damage reduction from enemies is incremental based on the number of suits obtained.
  * Varia Suit: Negates heat and cold damage, and reduces lava and acid damage by 40%. If gravity suit is also active, lava damage is negated.
  * Gravity Suit: Allows free movement in water and lava. Does not reduce environmental damage.
* Added: Configurable environmental damage per second.
* Added: Optional setting to allow use of power bombs without normal bombs.
* Added: Optional setting to allow use of missiles without main missile data.

* Fixed: Vanilla aim lock bug where Samus's aim would get locked into a diagonal direction without holding the diagonal aim button.
* Fixed: Vanilla SA-X invulnerability softlocks in both Samus form and monster form.
* Changed: Slightly rework how Red-X drops work. Their chances for enemies have been bumped to 1.117%, and there is now a guaranteed drop when you ran out of PBs but have max health/missiles.
